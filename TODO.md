# SimpleVTT — Planned Features

Backlog of features to implement. Not prioritized — order is arbitrary.

---

## Bulk Map Upload
Allow GMs and admins to upload multiple map images at once (e.g. a zip or multi-file picker) rather than one at a time. Should probably show a progress indicator and let the user assign names/grid settings to each before committing.

## Resources
A dedicated section for GMs and admins to upload documents (PDFs, images, handouts) that players can view directly in the browser — inline PDF rendering, no download required. Needs access control so GMs can choose whether a resource is visible to all players or GM-only.

## Player Notes
Per-player scratchpad (rich text or markdown) scoped to a campaign. Notes should be private to the player by default, with an optional "share with GM" toggle. Persisted server-side so they survive page refreshes.

## Reporting Page
Admin/GM dashboard showing campaign activity: session count, token move history, roll statistics, active players over time. Useful for GMs who want a post-session summary.

## Slide-Out Menu for Mobile
On small screens, replace the current sidebar with a proper slide-out drawer triggered by a hamburger button. The map should fill the full viewport and the drawer overlays it rather than pushing it. Needs gesture support (swipe to open/close).

## Darker Sepia Themes
Add a few darker sepia/warm-brown colour themes as alternatives to the existing dark theme. Candidates: a deep parchment (dark tan background, inked-brown text), a candlelit tavern (very dark brown with amber accents), and a burnt manuscript (near-black with faded sepia highlights). Should slot into the existing theme system with new CSS variable sets — no structural changes needed.

## Dynamic Character Art Updates
When a player updates their character portrait on their sheet, the change should propagate in real time to the tabletop — updating the token image, the player list, and any other places the portrait is displayed — without requiring a page reload. Should use the existing WebSocket broadcast infrastructure so all connected clients (GM and other players) see the new art immediately.

## GM Access to All Character Sheets
GMs should be able to open and read any player's character sheet in the campaign directly from the tabletop or campaign settings, without needing to be assigned as the character's owner. Read-only access is the minimum; optionally allow the GM to make edits (e.g. to update HP after a session or correct a mistake). Needs a clear UI entry point — likely a "View Sheet" button next to each character in the GM's player list.

## Hide Spells from Non-Casters
The spells section of the character sheet should be hidden (or collapsed) when the character's class has no spellcasting ability. Currently the spell panel is visible for all characters regardless of class. Detection should use the `class_spellcasting` field — hide the section when it is blank, and show it for any class with a spellcasting ability set (INT, WIS, CHA, etc.). Should also handle multiclass characters where at least one class is a caster.

## Ability Score Generation
Two methods for players to generate ability scores during character creation:
- **Point buy** — players spend a fixed pool of points (standard D&D 5e: 27 points, scores 8–15 before racial bonuses) with an interactive cost table shown in the sheet UI. Should enforce the budget in real time and show remaining points.
- **Dice rolling** — roll 4d6 drop lowest for each attribute, with an in-sheet button per score and a "Re-roll all" option. Should show the individual dice results before committing. Optionally allow the GM to lock or unlock rerolls per campaign.

## Map Editor Framework
Groundwork for in-browser map authoring tools. Planned capabilities:
- **Fog of war** — GM-controlled reveal of map regions; players see only explored areas
- **Walls** — line segments that block token line-of-sight
- **Doors** — interactive wall segments that players/GMs can open or close
- **Clickable items** — hotspots on the map that trigger a description popup or roll prompt
- **Multi-map encounters** — link multiple maps into a single encounter (e.g. interior/exterior transitions) without switching the active map for the whole campaign

## Playlist Builder with Existing Songs
Allow GMs to create playlists from tracks already uploaded to the campaign rather than re-uploading. UI: a picker listing existing campaign audio tracks, drag-to-reorder, save as a named playlist. Backend: new playlist model + endpoints; guard file deletion to prevent removing audio that is still referenced by a playlist.

## Initiative Tracker Roll Prompt
When a combatant is added to the initiative order without a roll (e.g. added mid-combat from the token sheet or manually), show the GM a "Prompt Roll" button next to that entry. Clicking it sends a WebSocket message to the relevant player's client asking them to roll initiative. The button disappears automatically once the player's initiative is recorded (either via self-roll or GM entry).

## Philips Hue Integration
Allow GMs to sync Philips Hue smart lights with tabletop events — e.g. dim lights on combat start, flash red on a critical hit, restore brightness when combat ends. Should connect to the local Hue Bridge (mDNS or manual IP) and allow the GM to map VTT events to Hue scenes or brightness/colour changes in campaign settings.
